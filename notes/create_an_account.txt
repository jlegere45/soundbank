    Creating an account is really composed of two parts, creating an account i.e. providing enough 
    information to fill out an entry in our database, and then once a valid entry is created, letting a user  
    with the proper login credentials sign into their account and access all of their own data.

    There are two types of users, content creators and listeners. A content creator is also a listener but not
    the other way around. That is to say that a content creator can also follow other artists. A listener can 
    set up their account to upload content after filling out form on a webpage.

    The database schema for a user
        id: incrementing integers
        username: string 
        email: string 
        password: salted and hashed string
        session_token: uuid for the user's current session
        registered: boolean
        content_name: string
        content_url: string
        content_about: string

    Only content creators will need the fields starting with 'content_' Otherwise they will just be null/empty string


    
    NOTE: We also need to provide the ability to delete accounts, but that will come after the demo.
